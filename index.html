        <h4>Series Summary</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The First Law is a fantasy series written by British author Joe
            Abercrombie. It consists of a trilogy and three stand-alone novels
            set in the same world.
          </li>
          <li>Written by author Joe Abercrombie.</li>
          <li>
            The series follows six characters who's stories eventually begin to
            overlap and compete with each other.
          </li>
          <li>
            The tone of the books can best be described as dark and gritty
            fantasy and could easily be recommended to fans of A Song of Ice And
            Fire/Game of Thrones.
          </li>
          <li>
            The series has since been expanded with 3 standalone novels set in
            the same world and another triology of books that take place 15
            years after the original triology.
          </li>
          <li>
            My favourite character within the series is Logen Ninefingers given
            his character development and archetype as a barbarian hero within
            the story.
